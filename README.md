# Customer Segmentation Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis using unsupervised learning techniques applied to a retail dataset. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced analytics, the project aims to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. The ultimate goal is to empower businesses with actionable information for targeted marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and enhanced retention efforts.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, filtering out irrelevant entries, and ensuring data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing distributions of key variables such as quantity, unit price, and transaction count by country.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features such as total transaction amount to enrich the dataset.
- Dimensionality reduction: Implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing feature space while preserving meaningful information.
- Clustering analysis: Utilizing K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
- Visualization: Plotting clusters on scatter plots for intuitive interpretation and actionable insights.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
